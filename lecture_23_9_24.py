######    EXCEPTION HANDLING   ######
# you have to look at first error type and error explanation
# if there are syntax errors first syntax will solve
# if you don't expect another errors let python give you errors


# Exception Handling is a technique in programming that allows a program to respond to and manage errors or exceptional conditions that occur during runtime.
# When a program encounters an error, it could crash or behave unexpectedly.
# Exception handling ensures that such errors are caught and handled gracefully, allowing the program to continue or exit safely.
# try: Contains the code that may cause an error.
# except: If an error occurs in the try block, the except block executes.
# else: If no error occurs in the try block, the else block runs.
# finally: Executes no matter what, whether an exception occurs or not, often used for cleanup.
